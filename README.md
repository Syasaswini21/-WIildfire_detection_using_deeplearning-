# -WIildfire_detection_using_deeplearning-
Wildfire detection using deep learning is a cutting-edge approach to detect wildfires early, leveraging AI and CCTV imagery. The idea is to train a deep learning model (like VGG16) on satellite images or drone footage to spot wildfires quickly. This can help with rapid response, reducing damage and risks.
